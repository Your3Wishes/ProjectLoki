# Project Loki

Project Loki is the codename for a VR game built in the Unity 3D engine. It is still a major work in progress, but feel free to contribute or play the game for yourself!

Repository branching is as follows:

Master - This is the branch that contains the current stable version of the game.

Development - This is the branch to which all "Feature Branches" are merged. This will be merged with the master branch periodically.

"Feature Branch" - When working on a new feature, branch from development and create a pull request to it when finished.
